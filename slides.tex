examined, reasoned about, and used to inform future decisions (help to explain something about the data)

 \begin{itemize}
  \item We cannnot use the the same data for training and testing. E.g. evaluating a student with exercises previouly solved. Student ‘s marks will be optimistic and we don’t know about student capability to generalise learned concepts.

\alert{Holdout approach} consists of dividing the dataset into training (approx. 2/3 of the data) and testing (approx 1/3 of the data).

Problems: Skewed data, missing classes, etc. if randomly divided

\alert{Stratification} ensures that each class is represented with approximately equal proportions, e.g., if data contains aprox 45\% of positive cases, the training and testing datasets should mantain similar proportion of positive cases. 

Holdout estimate can be made more reliable by repeating the process with different subsamples (\alert{repeated holdout method})

\alert{Cross-validation} (CV) avoids overlapping test sets. The $k$-fold CV consists on:
\begin{itemize}
 \item First step: split dataset ($\mathcal{D}$) into $k$ subsets of equal size $C_1,\ldots,C_k$. Subsets are generally stratified before the CV is performed

 \item Second step: we construct a dataset $D_i = D-C_i$ used for \emph{training} and test the accuracy of the classifier $f(D_i)$ on $C_i$ subset for \textit{testing}
 
\end{itemize}

The error estimates are averaged to yield an overall error estimate, i.e., having done this for all $k$, usually $k=10$, we estimate the accuracy of the method by averaging the accuracy over the $k$ cross-validation.

% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Number of correct classifications:
%     $$\sum^N_{i=1} \delta(c^{(i)}, c^{(i)}_M)$$ where 
%     $\delta(c^{(i)}, c^{(i)}_M)=\{1 if c^{(i)}, c^{(i)}_M, 0 otherwise$
% 
%   % \item For probabilistic classifiers Brier score (1950)
%   % $bs(\mathcal{D})=\frac{1}{N}\sum \sum...$
% 
%   \item Many times we need to combine the TP and FP to estimate the goodness of a classifier. For example, with imbalanced data, the accuracy of a classifer needs to improve the percentage of the mayority class. In a binay problem and 50/50 distribution, we need improve accuracy over 50\%. However if the distribution is 90/10, accuracy needs to be over 90\%

Increasing the tree size, decreases the training and testing errors. However, at some point after (tree complexity), training error keeps decreasing but testing error increases

Many algorithms have parameters to determine the model complexity (e.g., in decision trees is the prunning parameter)

% %\begin{block}{Conclusions}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item FS obtains better accuracy than the datasets using all attributes
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%       The wrapper model is superior to the filter model
%       \begin{itemize}
%         \item
%           It either improves the accuracy, or when the accuracy is not improved, 
% the models generated are much simpler, i.e., low no. of attributes; e.g., for 
% the JM1 dataset, the accuracy using IB1 wrapper is 72.01\% compared with 79.73\% 
% when using all attributes, however, it just needs less than 3 attributes for an 
% \emph{acceptable} accuracy.
%      \end{itemize}
%      \item The drawback is that the wrapper model is computationally expensive 
% (some runs took around a week to finish).
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item From the SE point of view, FS finds important attributes (for these 
% datasets, FS has removed most derived attributes.

% \begin{itemize}
%         \item Future work: other datasets with more classes, how to deal and 
% analyze unbalanced datasets, etc.
